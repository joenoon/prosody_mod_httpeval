mod_httpeval is a prosody module, similar in power to mod_console, but over http.

It evaluates straight lua code inside the scope of prosody, so most anything that
could be hard-coded directly into prosody can be run via mod_httpeval.

Configuration:
===

modules_enabled = {
  ... other stuff ...
  "httpeval";
}

httpeval_ports = { 8190 };
httpeval_interface = "127.0.0.1";
httpeval_handshake = "some-secure-hash";
  
Usage:
===

POST to http://127.0.0.1:8190/http-eval/?handshake=YOUR_HANDSHAKE

(the BODY of the POST should be valid lua code)

The response will be prefixed with one of: 
  "Error: ", "Result: ", "Message: ", "OK: "

Your code can take that into account when examining responses.

Caution:
===

As with console, use with caution.  This should probably be firewalled and
have a secure handshake.
